<h1>Project Description</h1>
For my MSDS Machine Learning 1 project, I developed a Multinomial Naive Bayes model for SMS spam text classification. The model achieved 98% test accuracy and 93% F1 score by leveraging techniques like Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF for text data preprocessing.

<h2>Highlights</h2>
- The Multinomial Naive-Bayes model demonstrated its advantage on highly sparse data as compared to our ML1 models.
- SMS Spam text classification was the chosen use case with results showing better accuracy and speed.
- We used and compared two options to vectorize our text data: Count Vectorizer and TFIDF Vectorizer.
- We introduced the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP).
- Our model achieved a test accuracy of ~98% and an F1 score of ~93%.
